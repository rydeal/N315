# Jungle Cook Website

This was created using an MVC model and view injection. This site is a mockup of a sample recipe website, and has mostly full responsiveness down to 768x1024. 
It was made with the viewport of 1280x800 in mind.
The intended functionality of the website was for users to have a browse recipes that include what the dish is, the ingredients needed, the instructions for making it as well as the serving size and time to make.
With an account, users would be able to add their own personal recipes, view them, edit them, and delete them.
